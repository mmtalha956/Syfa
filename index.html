Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm...

See you face to face,

You...
Even if it's true.
Even if it's true.
(You, babe...)
Even if it's true.

There's no reason to believe,
I'll save us now.
But if you really love me,
Say it now.

Why is it so hard to figure out?
I need you every day,
Believe me when I say it...

Like I want you.
You...
Even if it's true.
Even if it's true.

Sometimes I wish you knew,
But I disguise the truth.
I say I'm happy,
But I'm still stuck on us,
Mmm, mmm, mmm...

Does your mind play this game too?
Think 'bout me and you?
I guess I'll just pretend,
Until it all makes sense,
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm...

See you face to face,
I'm thinking 'bout the days we used to be.
But I can't make a scene,
No, I can't make a scene...

Tell me your point of view.
Tell me, am I to blame?
You're so good with change,
Hmm, mmm, mmm...

A table set for two,
You got me waitin' but you ain't comin' through.
Try to stay patient but gotta face the truth,
